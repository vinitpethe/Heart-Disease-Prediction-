PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project involves a comprensive Explotary Data Analysis (EDA) performed using Python and Jupyter Notebool. It demonstrates my ability to understand, clean, and analyze datasets to uncover patterns, trands and actionable insights

This analysis includes:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Descriptive statistics

Visual exploration using Matplotlib and Seaborn

Correlation analysis

Key findinds with business relevance
